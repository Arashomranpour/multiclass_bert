# Multiclass Classification with BERT

This project implements a multiclass classification system using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. It leverages BERT's pre-trained capabilities to classify text into multiple categories, making it ideal for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Features

- **BERT for Multiclass Classification**: Utilizes a pre-trained BERT model to classify text into multiple categories.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The BERT model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset to improve performance on specific tasks.
- **Efficient Text Classification**: Supports efficient and accurate classification, even with large datasets.
- **NLP Pipeline**: Provides a full NLP pipeline from text preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `bert_multiclass_nlp.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that contains the complete workflow for training and testing the multiclass BERT model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies needed to run the project.
- `README.md`: Overview and documentation for the project.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arashomranpour/multiclass_bert.git
    cd multiclass_bert
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
    Launch `bert_multiclass_nlp.ipynb` in Jupyter and execute the cells to fine-tune the BERT model and perform text classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `transformers`: Hugging Face's transformers library for BERT.
- `datasets`: A library to load and process NLP datasets.
- `sklearn`: For model evaluation and performance metrics.
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebook files)

## Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can run the notebook to:
- Preprocess text data for multiclass classification.
- Fine-tune the BERT model on your dataset.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Enhancements

- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with different optimization techniques to improve model performance.
- **Additional NLP Tasks**: Extend the model to handle other NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition (NER).
- **Dataset Integration**: Integrate more diverse datasets to further fine-tune the model across various tasks.
